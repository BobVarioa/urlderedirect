# urlderedirect

Tired of those annoying "are you sure you want to go to this page?" sites? This just changes those urls to point to where they actually go. This also prevents those sites from knowing if you clicked on those urls too, if that's your thing ;). 

Feel free to suggest a new site in an issue, and I'll gladly add it!
